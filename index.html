      <p>Hi and welcome to my online portfolio. My name is Osama Ahmed and I am a Computer Games Development Graduate from the University of Westminster.</p>
      <p>I enjoy working on the gameplay side of games the most as this is the main part which gets a game working from the mechanics to how things interact together in the world. I also enjoy working on other parts of games such as AI.</p>
      <p>Another thing which I enjoy taking part in are game jams as they are never predictable, every game jam has a different theme and me and my team must come up with a new idea. It is also incredibly fun to work with friends on a creating a game from scratch in a very limited time.</p>
      <p>Overall I am very interested in all types of technology whether it is games or software development. I have become increasingly interested in the Swift language and the iOS development environment and have been learning it for about 6 months. It has been such a great learning experience and I am still learning new things everyday.</p>
